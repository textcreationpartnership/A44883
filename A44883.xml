            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>HUbbabow, Hullalow, Hullalow, undone, undone, undone, fait and trote a gra, the man with the Club Foot has rob'd me of all my Honesty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Prethe how much hadst thou?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>Oh cram a cree, I had a grain and a half left me by my Father and Mother, and I hid it in my Box of Sneezing, and this club-footed fellow snatch'd it from me, and ran away with it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>It may be it was <hi>J. Arthur.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>No, by St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> I dare swear he has none of it; he would not take it up if he found it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but leave thy howling, and be of good cheer, thy Loss is not great, what great necessity is there for Honesty? By thy Life and Conversation, by thy Oaths and Perjuries, a man would swear thou never had any. I thought thou hadst valued one grain of Sneezing before a pound of Honesty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, so I doe; but I kept this for fear a Parliament should come and find me without it: For I have heard many say, that Honesty is the best Policy: I purpos'd to have kept Honesty in one Hand, and Knavery in the other; for a double Dealer is the only thriving man in this Age.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>Thou art a Fool to think that Honesty will lodge in a Box with Knavery. What agreement is there between God and <hi>Belial?</hi> No more than there is between <hi>Hethrington</hi> and <hi>Macknamarra,</hi> or between <hi>Bourk</hi> and <hi>Ivy.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>Oh but though I stink above ground now, yet I intended hereafter to be made sweet with my grain and a half of Honesty; and to tell the truly, I kept it to stand like a <hi>Moses</hi> in the Gap, to keep me from hanging: I would not give a Potatoe for my Brogue full of it, but for fear of an after Clap.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>Leave thy blubbering Man, thou art many miles distant from a Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>That's my Comfort <hi>Whig;</hi> but to my great grief, I saw in my Dream a great long, Scroll of all our Rogueries in my L—d <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Hand, which he spread just like a Table-cloath before the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and Oh how it did nettle me! It put me into such a violent Sweat, that when I awaked, I thought verily I had fallen into my Mother's bonny Clabber Pot. I could have wisht my self a grain of Barly, that my Father might have grinded me to Powder in his Quirn: My Heart was as heavy as if I had been Hag-ridden: I had not one free part about me; one would have thought the Quakers had bad a general Meeting in my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for every Member fell a trembling. That Scrole was just like <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s Hand-writing upon the Wall: It made my Face look pale, and my Eyes hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and my Knees smote one against another. I fancied I had swallowed <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> there were such strange Shapes and Apparitions in my Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Now methought I saw <hi>Roger</hi> hang <hi>Strange 'Lee</hi> upon a Gibbet by the two Thumbs, and his Brother <hi>Harry Clytus</hi> weeping for fear of the same Fate. Anon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56198:2"/>I fancyed the Devil <hi>Tooke Ben.</hi> from his Ship in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church Yard, and the froth of <hi>Heraclytus</hi> his Brains, and burnt them <hi>omnium gethrum.</hi> After that methought there came half a dozen <hi>Dons</hi> from the Tower with their Heads in their Hands, and flung them at Old <hi>Nick,</hi> which serv'd the Boys for Foot-balls, till their Brains were beat out; and then came the grave <hi>Joanna</hi> (in her sable Weeds) with a Broom in her Hand, and swept them up, and sold them to the Priests for Relicks: Then began I to think of my Honesty. Oh thought I, what would I not give to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in this day of Visitation? I conceited <hi>Thompson;</hi> and a whole Tribe of Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Evidences ran away faster than the Embassador of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Estriches could do, and Justice pursued them, but could not overtake them; and the Protestants prick'd up their Ears, and were as brisk as a Body-Louse. Oh though I, what a doleful day and what dismal Sights are these? Verily my Britch made Buttons, and I wisht with all my Heart, than when I lost my Honesty I had lost my Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Honesty is a Jewel though now but little regarded by those of your Gang; and I know not how you will get it again, unless you throw away your Knavery; take my Advice <hi>Tory,</hi> mourn for thy Perjuries, and thy ill Practices; abhor them, and that Devil that put thee upon such unwarrantable Actions: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not <hi>Romun</hi> Gold before Heavenly Grace; nor the Promises of Mammon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Promises of God: Do not make a Vertue of Necessity; but let Honesty be thy Delight and thy Choice, when there is no Sign of a Parliaments appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as when they are at thy Elbow: My Life for thine <hi>Tory,</hi> there are many of your Crue who now abhor our Parliaments, that will wish with <hi>Balaam,</hi> that they had died the Death of the righteous; and that their last end had been like theirs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>Well, they go far that never return: I'm afraid of their meeting, tho' we use our utmost Interest to the contrary, by Sham-plots, Evil Council, and many other pretty Devices.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>But if thou hadst had but thy Grain and a half of Honesty, thou wouldst not have fear'd their Meeting, if thou fearest a Parliament, only because of a few false Oaths, what may they do who stop the Streams of Justice? What may they do who abhor them, and go quite contrary in all their Actions to the Parliaments good Will and Pleasure? What may they do who vilifie them, and abuse them in Triumph, and labor by all means possible to dethrone our good King, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt an evil Pope?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>To.</speaker>
               <p>What must they do? They must go to hing hang 'em, by what Names or Titles soever they are dignify'd or distinguish'd, whether the Right Reverend Square Caps, or the most Learned Round Caps, the raskally Penshioners, or the Roguish Papists, Noll's Fidlers, or the Pope's Printers, the Popish Miss, or the Devil's Midwife.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wh.</speaker>
               <p>And then when they come to take their last Degrees at the three leg'd Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we shall have some singing their late invented Song, <hi>Hey Boys up go we.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Old Song of Innocency, like their Fore-fathers, <hi>Harcourt, Ireland, Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Plunket, Whitebread,</hi> &amp;c. though there be a thousand Witnesses against them.</p>
